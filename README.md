## Overview
This project aims to build a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a significant financial and security issue, and early detection can prevent losses for both cardholders and financial institutions. This system leverages supervised learning methods to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **[Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**.

### Key Details:
- **Number of Transactions**: 284,807  
- **Number of Fraudulent Transactions**: 492  
- **Class Imbalance**: Approximately 0.172% of transactions are fraudulent.  
- **Features**: The dataset contains 30 features, including anonymized features `V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`, `Time`, and `Amount`.

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the class distribution.
   - Visualize data patterns and correlations.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize the `Amount` and `Time` features.
   - Handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Evaluate the significance of features.
   - Remove redundant or less important features if necessary.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Train multiple classifiers such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
     - Neural Networks
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
   - Focus on reducing False Negatives to avoid undetected fraud.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Export the best model using `joblib` or `pickle` for integration into a web application or API.
